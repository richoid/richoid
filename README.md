- 👋 Hi, I’m Rich Webster: @richoid
- 👀 I’m a tech writer for a non-profit-not-evil health insurance company, who is dabbling in web dev on the side. I used to be a web dev. It's better as a hobby, at least for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TALL Stack
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- 📫 How to reach me...? yeah, probably not. Did I mention I'm an introvert? Yes, very.
